=========================================

This repository contains the following assets:

- Simple Moon shader graph (non-physically based) with texture assets
- Simple Earth shader graph (non-physically based) with texture assets

These shader graphs use Built-in Render Pipeline support, which was newly
introduced in Unity 2021.2. You can use [the old version] (standard shader
implementation) for previous versions of Unity.

[the old version]:

Although the sample project was built on the Built-in Render Pipeline, you can
also use other SRPs (URP/HDRP) by switching the graph target.
